Work Dad Scheduler 

This is a calender application that records hourly tasks input by the user to local storage. The hourly calender will visually indicate what task the user should be on and what tasks are past and what are coming up.

The calender was made using Bootstrap API, Moment.js to track the time, and coded in jquery.
